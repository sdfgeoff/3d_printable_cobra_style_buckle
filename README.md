# 3D printable Cobra Clip

This is a 3D printable cobra-clip made in FreeCAD and nicely parameterized. The current
preset is for a (tiny) 15mm webbing and being held together with filament-rivets.

Because it's printed, we can integrate the springs into the pawls so the part count is
very low (I don't know why other 3D printable cobra buckles don't do this). 

It is designed to be easy to release under load (actuating the clips doesn't requiqre the
buckle to move).

# Patent Information
The Cobra Buckle is patented until 2031 as US8561268B2 to AustrailPin who make rock-climbing
gear. Production or sale of this item
may possibly count as infringing this patent despite some differences in design. This includes
production for personal use. 
Publishing the design here does not (as far as I can tell) violate a patent because the 
patents block _production_ of an item not the _design_. This repository and the files therein can 
be considered a detailed sketch replicating the design freely available in the patent, 
rather than a physical production of the design. 

However, the general shape of a cobra buckle has been patented under USD621743S1, so you cannot
produce things that _look_ like a cobra buckle (I did not know this was possible)

So in theory the files in the repository are freely shareable, but cannot be produced.

## Why producting this item (may) not infringe

### Functionality Difference
Austalpin's designs are all designed to be impossible to release under load. This design
is the opposite. It is designed to be easy to release under load.


### Claim 6:
Claim 6 states:

```
A belt buckle according to claim 1, wherin the latches in their locking positions are
acted upon by spring elements.
``` 
The design in the reposity does NOT comply with claim 6:

1. The springs are integrated into the latches, therefore the latches are not acted upon by spring elements, they are their own spring elements.

2. When the latches are in the locked position, the latches built-in-springs do not apply any
force onto the latches. Therefore again, the latches are not _acted_ upon when the latches are
in their locking position

As a result the files in this repository represent a "new invention" as it does not 
comply with Claim 6.

### Claim 1d and 7d and 8d
Claim 1d, 7d and 8d state:

```
The insertion opening beginning at the inserting side of the basic body and forming a
penetrating opening pentrating the basic body to the belt opening.
```


The design in this repository does NOT comply with claim 7d or 8d because the hole into 
which the insertion part is insertedðŸ˜Š does not penetrate into the belt opening.  

In fact, the patent even mentions a similar buckle (Background column 1, line 59) that
lacks this feature and instead has a blind hole, however some other differences are also
mentioned so the unnamed buckle there would not constitute prior art.

(This was actually an oversight on my part when doing the design, and means that my design
is more succeptable to debris. It would however be pretty trivial to add a debris clearing
port that opened to the top or the bottom and it still wouldn't comply with claims 7d or 8d.)

### Conclusion
I do not consider my design to be a replication of Patent US8561268B2. But I am not a 
patent lawyer, and it may not hold up in court. 

There are several other trivial modifications that could be made to the design to make it
not comply with sections various parts of the patent. 

## Summary
So in theory the files in this repository are _definitely_ freely shareable but manufacturing
them is _possibly_ against one of the several patents in this area. 
If you 3D print one of these it is at your own risk.
